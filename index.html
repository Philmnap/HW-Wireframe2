            <p>
                <p> My name is Philipp Rivadeneira. Coding is something that I like to do and I am hoping to be a full
                    stack
                    developer. When I am not coding I love to go skiing in Colorado with my dad. My favorite resort to
                    ski in that
                    I
                    have been to is Vail because it's almost like being in 3 different resorts at times. They have three
                    different
                    sides that can be skiied. I am a pretty advanced skiier, so I don't need to turn down any difficult
                    slopes at
                    this point.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Aside from skiing, I like to watch lots of baseball. My favorite teams to watch are the Royals and
                    Twins.
                    Yes,
                    I like teams in the same division. But they are very comparable teams and play a similar style over
                    the years.
